#Homework Assignment #1

1. What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
    I had a hard time figuring out how the code should be laid out since I don't have too much experience in coding. Using the sample provided made it much easier in understanding what the steps and prcoess should be. It became easier the more I coded and understood the assignment.
2. What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
    I thought the requirements were reasonable and outlined fully what we should be looking to complete. The requirements represented typical test case scenarios.
3. What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
    My biggest challenge was understanding the code layout and how the output should ideally look like. I think I completing it to a sufficient standard but perhaps there was more to be expected of me.
4. Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
    I used the assignment outline as a reference of how much should be included. Once I had a decent amount of data and test cases for all scenarios I felt the assignment was appropriately done.
